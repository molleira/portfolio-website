## Portfolio Website

![Demo](demo/demo.gif)

As I have been learning to program I have realised that I needed to create a space that would allow me to gather the different projects I have been working on in order to show them in an appealing way.

This project includes the files that make up the website I use as a portfolio. This page contains details of some of the featured projects I have worked on as well as personal and contact information.

Please click [in this link](https://www.marcoller.net/) to visit my portfolio website.

### About
The project has been created with **HTML** and **CSS** mainly, although I have also used some **JavasCript** to implement a better browsing experience.

I have used *semantic* tagging and I have tried to make it *accessible* to as many visitors as possible.

The stylesheet uses *variables* as well as the *BEM* (Block Element Modifier) system for naming classes. I have added *comments* to make it easy to understand and I have not used preprocessors, so you can edit the code directly.

The project contains an *SVG* file that is animated using *keyframes*.

Finally, the script uses a bit of *jQuery* but is easy to edit if you prefer to use vanilla javaScript.

### Development
In the future I intend to turn this page into a React project, as well as keeping it updated. I will be adding more projects in the future and improving the user experience.

### Usage
Please let me know if you would like to use this project as a template to create your personal portfolio. I'll be happy to get in touch and help with whatever you need.

This project is based on a course from Scrimba, I strongly recommend you to have a look at it.
